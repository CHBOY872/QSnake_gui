Steps to complete:
    Generate ObjectProcessor
        - it should process each string which should be passed to the ObjectProcessor
        - it should support mid-flow datas
        - it should draw objects (Snake, Other snake, Food, Field)
        - in case of F object:
            - it should draw a Field (cells)
        - on other cases:
            - it should draw each cell

    Add head for other snake
    refactor a code
    Optional: create UI for server lookup
